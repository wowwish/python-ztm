import requests # For using API to check number of password hacks for a given password
import hashlib # built-in python module with hash functions
import sys # for command-line arguments

# We should send a hashed password to the API endpoint in the query of the GET request for a successful response
# Furthermore, to maintain K-anonymity (K-anonymity is a property of a dataset that indicates the 
# re-identifiability of its records. A dataset is k-anonymous if quasi-identifiers for each person in the dataset 
# are identical to at least k â€“ 1 other people also in the dataset), only the first 5 characters of the hashed 
# password string is sent with the API. The API then matches all password strings in its database that have the 
# same first 5 hash characters and returns results for all these password strings. 
# This way, our exact password hash (and thereby, the password string itself) is not exposed to the API and 
# someone cannot decrypt password by guessing its hash using a hash-function generator for password-strings.


# HASH FUNCTIONS are functions that generate a fixed length value for an input. This fixed length value is very
# specific to the input ... even a single character change in the input will completely change the HASH FUNCTION
# output, however, the same input will generate the same hash value out of the hash function (This property is
# called Indempotency). In most cases, there is no way to get the original input from the hash value recieved 
# from the hash function. Hash Functions are used widely in data integrity and data security.
# Memory Addresses for data structures like Hash Tables (Dictionaries) are also based on hash functions. The data
# in a hash table is stored in a memory address that is mapped to the output of the hash function 
# applied to the data. This allows quick data access typical of Hash Tables (Dictionaries). Hash Functions slow 
# down the process of storing data in memory for Hash Tables and hence, an optimal hash function for quickly 
# developing an address to the data are neccessary.
